# PPHA 41501 · Game Theory — Open Collaboration

Shared repository for **PPHA 41501 Game Theory (PhD)**, Autumn 2026
(MACRM, Harris School of Public Policy, University of Chicago). Instructor: Konstantin Sonin.

A place to build up, over the quarter, a systematic body of work: rigorous proofs,
problem-set solutions, and related code.

> **Scope & copyright.** This repository contains only original, publicly shareable
> material. Instructor slides, the syllabus, and textbook PDFs (e.g. Osborne, Myerson)
> are **not** included here — they live outside this repo and may be copyrighted. Please
> do not add them.

## Layout

| Path | What goes here |
|---|---|
| `notes/` | Original lecture notes (one file per lecture), in your own words |
| `proofs/` | Theorem / proposition proofs, cleaned up and cross-referenced |
| `problem-sets/` | Solutions, organized as `ps01/`, `ps02/`, … |
| `data/` | Datasets you are allowed to share, plus data dictionaries |
| `code/` | Cleaning and analysis code (Python / R) |

## How to contribute

1. **Branch** — `git checkout -b ps01/alice` (or `proof/nash-existence`, `code/ha01`).
2. **Commit** — small, focused commits. Suggested messages: `ps01: solve part III`,
   `proof: add Nash existence`.
3. **Pull request** — open a PR into `main` and tag a maintainer. Keep each PR scoped to
   one problem set, one proof, or one code change.
4. **Math** — write math in LaTeX. Use separate `.tex` files for long derivations,
   Markdown for short write-ups.

### Conventions

- One theorem or proposition per file in `proofs/`.
- Always state your sources (slide page, Myerson / Osborne / MWG ch. 5–8) so others can verify.
- **Never** commit copyrighted course material — problem-set PDFs, slides, textbook
  scans. Paraphrase problems and write solutions in your own words.
